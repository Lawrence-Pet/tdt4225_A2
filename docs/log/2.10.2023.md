## Connection to DB
Had to change config file in ubuntu server inorder to connect. 

```conf
[mysqld]
#
# * Basic Settings
#
user            = mysql
# pid-file      = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
# socket        = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
# port          = 3306
# datadir       = /var/lib/mysql


# If MySQL is running as a replication slave, this should be
# changed. Ref https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.>
# tmpdir                = /tmp
#
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
bind-address           = 127.0.0.1
mysqlx-bind-address    = 127.0.0.1
```

Needed to comment out `bind-address` and `mysqlx-bind-address` in order to connect externally to the mysql server. 
Only approved localhost calls before.

## Timeformat in table
For some crazy reason the dataset is not in UNIX time, which is the superior time. Thus we need to deal with the format of days since december 30th 1899. lksjdf

Ole Time --> UNIX / EPOCH --> DATETIME
